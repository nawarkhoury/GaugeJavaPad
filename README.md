# GaugeJavaPad
Text Pad to write gauge specs with autocomplete from the declared gauge steps

# How to use
- Build the pad or copy its copy.
- add the jar or the code to your gauge project.
- Run the main class nawar.khoury.gauge.java.utilities.Pad as your main class, with your gauge project in the classpath
- Enjoy the simple Autocomplete feature!

# Why this library?
I use gauge as a test automation tool for java libraries, and I am unable to find a good gauge plugin for VSCode nor for eclipse.
I don't need syntax highlighting or any other cool feature, all I need is autocomplete, since it saves time and increases productivity in big projects where I have hundreds of steps implemented. This is why I wrote the simplest possible java swing application, that does exactly this! it matches what you are writing to the declared steps and gives you a simple auto complete feature!
